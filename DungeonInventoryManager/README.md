A TTRPG inventory management system I developed to use with my friends during our DnD campaign.
The system provides a plethera of commands to use such as: search item by name, make attack and more.
Currently a new command is being developed: Generate Image command will give players to visualize both their players and their Items.
The image generation is through PixArt_Sigma model:https://huggingface.co/PixArt-alpha/PixArt-Sigma/tree/main
